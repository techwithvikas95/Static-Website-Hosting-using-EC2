# Static-Website-Hosting-using-EC2
Static website hosted on AWS EC2 with Nginx, configured via SSH on Ubuntu Linux, showcasing real-world cloud deployment and server configuration.

#Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the deployment of a static website on an AWS EC2 instance using Nginx as the web server.
The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure, Linux server management, and real-world web hosting practices.

#Technologies Used:
* AWS EC2
* Ubuntu Linux
* Nginx
* HTML5
* CSS3
* SSH
* HTTP
* 
#Architecture Summary
Client Browser → Public IP → EC2 Instance → Nginx → Static Files

#Deployment Steps:
* Launched an Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS.
* Configured security group to allow inbound HTTP traffic on port 80.
* Connected to the server securely using SSH.
* Installed and started Nginx.
* Uploaded website files to /var/www/html.
* Verified deployment through the public IP address.
  
#What I Learned:
* How cloud servers are provisioned and managed in AWS.
* Practical use of SSH for secure remote server access.
* Basic Linux server administration and file management.
* How Nginx processes and serves static content.
* The complete lifecycle of an HTTP request from browser to server.
* Importance of security groups and port configuration.
* Foundational concepts of DevOps and cloud infrastructure.
  
#Key Takeaways:
This project strengthened my understanding of how websites are hosted in production environments.
It provided hands-on exposure to cloud deployment, networking fundamentals, and server configuration beyond theoretical learning.
